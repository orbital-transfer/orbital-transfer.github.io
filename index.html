<h1 id="whatisorbitaltransfer"><a name="index1h1"></a>What is Orbital Transfer?</h1>

<p>Orbital Transfer is a set of tools made to help developers manage their
execution environments. This is similar to what an IDE does when setting up a
project, but goes further in helping declaratively specifying the project's
relationship to other parts of the system both under the developer's control
and not.</p>

<h1 id="goals"><a name="index2h1"></a>Goals</h1>

<h2 id="relationshiptoothercode"><a name="index1h2"></a>Relationship to other code</h2>

<p>A distribution of code does not exist in a standalone environment. It has
dependencies on other aspects of the system it is running on such as the
architecture, operating system, paths to libraries, configuration settings.</p>

<h3 id="poly-repoversusmono-repo"><a name="index1h3"></a>Poly-repo versus mono-repo</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Declare the relationship between source code repositories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, a large project is broken into modules that can be used and tested
independently of other parts of the project. To keep track of changes to these
modules, developer's make decision to manage changes to these together
(mono-repo architecture) or apart (poly-repo architecture)
(see <a href="https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/monorepo-vs-polyrepo">more</a>).</p>

<p>The reason why a mono-repo may be used is that it makes it easier to advance
changes that cut across modules at a single time. When modules depend on each
other such a <code>B -(depends on)⟶ A</code>, making a change in <code>A</code> would also mean
possibly updating <code>B</code>. Keeping these changes together means that advancing
versions is easier especially if there are further modules <code>C, D, E -(depends on)⟶ B</code>
which would also possibly need to be updated. Though one could say that
if a change in one module causes so many changes downstream, the modules are
too highly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">coupled</a>.</p>

<p>However, a poly-repo is not that much harder to work with than a mono-repo if
one has the right tools. One could use branches and declare that a particular
branch can only work with changes before/past a certain point (e.g., version,
tag) on a dependency. Applying this to multiple repositories at once just
requires specifying at which point <code>Δ</code> the change in occurs then specifying
that everything before the change must be <code>&lt; ∆</code> and after must be <code>≥ Δ</code>. To
automate this, the tool needs access to the dependency graph between the
various repos that make up the poly-repo architecture.</p>

<p>Of course, this technical difference does not account for the communication dynamics
of the organization developing the software (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's law</a>).</p>

<h3 id="dependenciesinotherpackages"><a name="index2h3"></a>Dependencies in other packages</h3>

<p>Packages also depend on code outside of the developer's direct control. These
can apply to the entire system or just to the language environment that the
code is being developed in.</p>

<h4 id="systemdistributionpackagemanagement"><a name="index1h4"></a>System/distribution package management</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Declare system packages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often IDEs and language tooling just know about language-level dependencies and
help the developer resolve these, however, system-level dependencies are an
important part of testing and deployment.</p>

<p>Often these dependencies are things that are compiled for the entire system to
uses such as GUI toolkits, libraries, or services that need to be accessed by
the code (network servers, databases). Installing these often require
administrator permissions, system restarts, system-specific commands/paths, so
knowing the specifics of the system you are working with is necessary.</p>

<p>This system-specificity also applies to the package names themselves, such as
the GTK+3.0 library is known by <code>libgtk-3-0</code> on Debian, <code>gtk3</code> on Fedora, etc.
(see <a href="https://repology.org/project/gtk/versions">more</a>) and there are further
packages built from the same source that contain features such as development
files (headers, debugging builds, type maps) or documentation.</p>

<h4 id="languagepackagemanagement"><a name="index2h4"></a>Language package management</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Standardize how language packages are installed and declared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tooling for language package management is well-known by developers and these
can be used in many ways such as installing at the system level, per-user, or
per-project, each with benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<p>System packages are more for end-user use than language packages are. An
application could be distributed through a language package manager,
but it is more likely that language packages are installed to something like a
<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/123305/what-is-the-difference-between-the-lib-and-vendor-folders"><code>vendor/</code> directory</a>.
Developers tend to modify and extend language packages more than system
packages which means that tasks such as version pinning, custom builds, and
patching are more likely to be used there.</p>

<p>Furthermore, language packages can themselves have system packages that they
depend on. If my application ultimately depends on a language package that is a
binding for something provided by a system package, it would be best to declare
the <code>&lt;binding-package&gt; -(depends on)⟶ &lt;system-package&gt;</code> instead of
<code>&lt;application&gt; -(depends on)⟶ &lt;system-package&gt;</code>. For example, an application
that uses Gtk+3 using language package <a href="http://p3rl.org/Gtk3">Gtk3.pm</a> would have the following dependencies:</p>

<pre>perl:Gtk3 ⟶ perl:Glib::Object::Introspection (*)
perl:Gtk3 ⟶ debian:gir1.2-gtk-3.0 (runtime)

perl:Glib::Object::Introspection ⟶ perl:Glib (*)
perl:Glib::Object::Introspection ⟶ debian:libgirepository1.0-dev (build time)
perl:Glib::Object::Introspection ⟶ debian:libgirepository-1.0-1 (runtime)

perl:Glib ⟶ debian:libglib2.0-dev (build time)
perl:Glib ⟶ debian:libglib2.0-0 (runtime)</pre>

<p>Instead of listing these in each application that might use <code>perl:Gtk3</code>, it
would be better to have a package metadata repository to make these
dependencies reusable.</p>

<h4 id="cross-languagedependencies"><a name="index3h4"></a>Cross-language dependencies</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Declare dependencies across languages for polyglot projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you are not using a single language in a project and need to be able
to prepare a development environment that contains modules from multiple
language ecosystems. Language package managers usually only know about the
specific language/runtime they are written for and developers might not be able
to use system packages either because they are outdated or do not even exist.</p>

<p>Being able to specify dependencies on other language ecosystems and installing
those modules under a project environment allow for them to be distributed
together for deployment.</p>

<p>This can be made easier than remembering the flags and settings for each of the
language package managers (e.g., Maven, NPM, CPAN, pip, gem, etc.) and
language-specific environment managers (e.g., <code>rbenv</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, etc.). Instead
of having to write a script which combines these tools in an ad hoc fashion per
each project that needs cross-language dependencies and using tools that are
shell-specific, one could generate a configuration file (which can be read by
any language) that specifies where to find the installation path for each
component.</p>

<p>For me, this was motivated by trying to use packages for natural language
processing in Java and Python. Some of these are used mostly as libraries and
others can be used as servers. As opposed to working with C/C++ libraries which
can be installed to a prefix and are often self-contained,
packaging something like Java requires also packaging dependencies and
having access to the JVM.</p>

<h2 id="whynotidesorconfigurationmanagement"><a name="index2h2"></a>Why not IDEs or configuration management?</h2>

<p>An IDE could be configured to do many of the same tasks that I have outlined,
but then that information would likely be in the IDEs format and not easily
shared with others that do not use that particular IDE. This information is
also useful for running tasks in an environment where there is no IDE such as a
continuous integration server.</p>

<p>Some of what I'm proposing could be done with configuration management (e.g.,
CFEngine, Chef, Puppet, Ansible), but those are usually for whole systems so
the recipes aren't written in quite the way that would make sense for a
development environment. These configuration management tools often do not
understand the underlying build environments or languages and are mostly used
to deploy a set of pre-built packages.</p>

<p>I'm trying to fit in a niche inside of DevOps, but more dev-centric. I am
trying to do tasks an IDE would do if it knew more about the ecosystem of the
current project. Furthermore, IDE/editor plugins could certainly be created.</p>

<h2 id="reproduciblebuilds"><a name="index3h2"></a>Reproducible builds</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Help with creating packages/installers for deployment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While some of DevOps has focused on creating VM images/containers that contain
the final environment for a service/application, I believe there is still room
for tools that help with creating packages.</p>

<p>I could use a particular cross-platform package manager (e.g.
<a href="https://spack.io">Spack</a>, <a href="https://conda.io/">Conda</a>,
<a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, RPM (e.g., via
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RPM/AlienHowto">alien</a>))
to do some of what I had outlined in terms of dependency management, but when
using those tools, it is similar to creating your own system packages. This
limits you to the platforms that the package manager supports. One could
certainly use the dependency metadata to help create system packages for those package
managers, but creating system packages makes more sense later in the
development pipeline when deploying, not during day-to-day development.</p>

<h2 id="acombinatorialexplosion"><a name="index4h2"></a>A combinatorial explosion</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goal: Simplify complex sequences and combinations of development tasks by
  making them declarative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When doing a development task, often there is some setup involved before it can
be run. Often this setup of an environment (paths, environment variables) is
placed in a script that is sourced prior to starting work. These scripts are often
specific to the system they were written for with hard-coded paths, so they can
not be shared when working in a different configuration.</p>

<p>A declarative approach could help with setting up the appropriate environment
before running a task.</p>

<p>For example, maybe I want to run <code>git-bisect</code> on some code on FreeBSD, but I'm on a
Linux host. What if the tool knew how to download and start a virtual machine
with FreeBSD and install everything the project needs for FreeBSD, then run
<code>git-bisect</code> inside the virtual machine. I could just let it run and come back
in an hour and I've got the results.</p>

<p>Instead of having to write a bunch of task-specific configuration code to
glue something together, I could have a configuration such as</p>

<pre>Host: Linux x86_64
Target: FreeBSD 12.0 x86_64
  Package-Override:
     package: libfoo
     version: 1.23p24
Repo: foobar.git
  Build-Type: Debug
  Build-Options:
    - ASAN: on
    - Optimize-Level: 0
Task: git-bisect
   Good version: git SHA
   Bad version: git SHA
   Test: prove
Strategy: *</pre>

<p>and the tool could figure out a strategy to fulfill that by using Vagrant with
a FreeBSD image while retrieving all the project-specific variations by analyzing
the repository's files and repo-specific metadata. This task is not difficult
to do manually, it's just mindlessly repetitive and could be replaced by a
template.</p>

<p>I don't want to have to repeat the same configuration information multiple times
for different kinds of environments and each aspect of the environment adds to
the combination that needs to be supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>Runtime environment: local system (<code>chroot</code>), virtual machines (Vagrant),
emulators (<a href="./doc/development/virtualization/qemu/">QEMU</a>), containers (<a href="./doc/development/virtualization/docker/">Docker</a>, LXC), compatibility layer (<a href="./doc/development/virtualization/wine/">Wine</a>, NetBSD Binary Emulation)</li>
<li>Architectures: ARM 32/64, <code>x86_64</code></li>
<li>Targets: <a href="./doc/development/virtualization/webassembly/">WebAssembly</a>, <a href="./doc/development/cross-compilation/">cross-compilation</a></li>
<li><a href="./doc/development/continuous-integration/">CI/CD pipelines</a>: Jenkins, Travis CI, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines</li>
<li>IDEs: local IDEs, cloud IDEs (<a href="./doc/development/code-editor/gitpod/">Gitpod</a>, <a href="./doc/development/code-editor/eclipse-che/">Eclipse Che / Codenvy</a>),
notebooks (<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>)</li>
<li>Operating systems: GNU/Linux (<a href="./doc/development/system/debian/">Debian</a>, Fedora, SuSE), macOS (Homebrew, MacPorts, Fink), <a href="./doc/development/os/windows/">Windows</a> (<a href="./doc/development/system/msys2/">MSYS2</a>, vcpkg), *BSDs</li>
<li>Toolchains: <code>gcc</code>, <code>clang</code>, Visual Studio Build Tools, Oracle Developer Studio (Sun Studio), Open Watcom C/C++, Embarcadero C++Builder, Intel C++</li>
<li>Wrappers: <code>ccache</code></li>
<li>Build systems: <a href="./doc/development/build-tool/cmake/">CMake</a>, Gradle.</li>
<li>Remote transport: SSH, WinRM</li>
<li>Servers: HTTP, DBs, X11, VNC</li>
<li>Configuration: files, environment variables (e.g.,
application-specific such as <code>PORT</code>, libc/linker-specific such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>, <code>LD_DEBUG</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not hopelessly complex as each aspect has a straightforward way of
using them. One just has to figure out how to combine each of these
straightforward pieces.</p>

<p>One example of what I would like to do is generate configurations for cloud
IDEs. Several of these allow for configuring a project by using a YAML
configuration; by placing that configuration in a repository, you can start
writing and testing that project in your browser. It would be useful to only
specify configuration metadata once and output service-specific configurations.
It is also possible to support weird combinations that only make sense in a
cloud IDE context such as using VNC for X11 application output and running a
JavaScript VNC client — allowing one to develop graphical desktop applications
in a cloud IDE.</p>

<h2 id="refactoringtools"><a name="index5h2"></a>Refactoring tools</h2>

<p>I am still thinking of how I want to do refactoring tools, but I have written a
tool that lets me rename and move code between repositories that makes use of
Git branches and separates groups of repository moves and groups of renames
into separate commits so that the changes can be tracked.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Martin Fowler <a href="https://refactoring.com/">writes</a> that when he refactors, he
does not always have automated tools and that he does not always need them.</p></li>
<li><p>Kent Beck <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2011/10/thinking-and-refactoring/">writes</a> that he
tells people to "stop thinking" when refactoring. He also mentions separating
"vertical refactoring" from "horizontal refactoring".</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="design"><a name="index3h1"></a>Design</h1>

<h2 id="bootstrapping"><a name="index6h2"></a>Bootstrapping</h2>

<p>One of the first questions to answer is how can Orbital Transfer code install
itself on a fresh install? This question is important for dealing with
provisioning virtual machines as everything needed to run the software is not
necessarily available at first.</p>

<p>Right now the code "launches" Orbital Transfer by checking to see what package
manager the system has and installing the base interpreter using that then
scanning the Orbital Transfer code itself for dependencies and installing those.</p>

<h2 id="phases"><a name="index7h2"></a>Phases</h2>

<p>Some dependencies are only needed in certain phases of development.
Furthermore, those phases may need certain environments for running.</p>

<p>Right now I have defined the phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Author</em>: Needed to generate a source code distribution from code in the
repository. Not all code necessarily has an authoring phase.</li>
<li><em>Configuration</em>/<em>Build</em>: Needed to build the code from the source code
distribution and place it in its final install location.</li>
<li><em>Test</em>: Needed for testing the code before it has been installed.</li>
<li><em>Runtime</em>: Needed for when the installed code is run.</li>
</ul>

<p>For dependencies, it may be necessary to remove <em>Build</em> dependencies before
running the <em>Test</em> phase to test that a runtime is clean and that dependencies
are specified fully. This separation is useful for when people try to build on
one machine then deploy on another. One way of doing this is to use one
container to build and another to run the tests with shared build artifacts.</p>

<p>Another feature of these phases is that they may need to have different
environments. For example, installation of system packages usually requires
having root access while running tests is usually done as a non-privileged
user. A test may require having certain environment variables set such as
 flags enabling code coverage,
 flags for a system service,
 API keys,
 or paths to test data.
Another project may have tests that are only available when some other service
is running before the tests starts.</p>

<h2 id="featuressoftwarevariabilitysoftwareproductlines"><a name="index8h2"></a>Features / software variability / Software Product Lines</h2>

<p>One of the ideas I want to implement is a way of modeling features in software
that can be turned on and off. There should be a way to say that <code>B:feat2 -(depends on)⟶ A:feat1</code>
so that the granularity of dependencies can go down to the level of features.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/161964371">From the Linux Kernel to Cryptography APIs: Supporting and Leveraging Software Product Lines / Sarah Nadi</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="carryingyourenvironmentwithyou"><a name="index9h2"></a>Carrying your environment with you</h2>

<p>When running commands, combine both the command and the environment that the
command needs such as administrator privileges, environment variables, current
working directory. This helps with keeping state between each command, making
for reproducible builds, and easier to debug builds.</p>

<h2 id="front-end"><a name="index10h2"></a>Front-end</h2>

<ul>
<li>Command-line front-end, REPL (e.g., a list of commands for
interacting with different services that users can choose from interactively
by searching and tab-completing — kind of like what a command-line version of
an IDE would be)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thedeveloperloop"><a name="index11h2"></a>The developer loop</h2>

<p>Some affordances to help developers do the next step automatically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scan build software for message strings like "%s can
not be installed due to conflict with %s needed by %s" and then when running
the software and getting an error message, automatically searching for the
message online.</p></li>
<li><p>Intercepting calls to <code>pkg-config</code> and installing the corresponding package
automatically.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mirroringandcaching"><a name="index12h2"></a>Mirroring and caching</h2>

<h3 id="reducingbuildtimes"><a name="index3h3"></a>Reducing build times</h3>

<p>Part of the development process is waiting for your code to build and test in
order to get feedback on your changes. Caching certain aspects of the build
can help speed up the build. There should be an easy way to enable/disable
caching for a project and a way to share those caches with downstream
dependencies if they opt-in (for example if you are building something from the
<em>Author</em> phase onwards).</p>

<p>How caching works depends on which type of caching you are doing and where the
caches will reside. Different language tooling caching works differently. Some
caches are small and some are large. Some caching locations need API keys and
depending on where it is running those are supplied in different ways.</p>

<h3 id="cachemeoutside:whenyouhavenointernet"><a name="index4h3"></a>Cache me outside!: when you have no Internet</h3>

<p>Orbital Transfer should let people offline their environments for development
and installation. I'd like to sit in a green field and write greenfield code.</p>

<p>This can take several forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mirroring system/language packages so that they can be installed in a virtual
environment without having to download from the Internet.</li>
<li>Mirroring documentation/examples for reading and indexing so that an Internet
connection is not needed to look up how to use code.</li>
</ul>
