# Bootstrapping

- Current
    * config:
        + Install directory
            + global install: no directory specified (so installs to `perl -V:sitelib`)
            + CI install: in `~/.orbital`.
                + Only when $ENV{CI} is true
            + default: relative to launch-site repo
    * steps:
        1. Install `cpm` (from vendor submodules) if not available
        2. Install `cpanm` using `cpm`.
        3. Install `App::scan_prereqs_cpanfile` using `cpanm`.
        4. Generate a `cpanfile` for every orbital-transfer submodule.
        5. Install dependencies from `cpanfile` for every orbital-transfer
           submodule using `cpm` then `cpanm`.
- Future
    * config:
        + Install to directory, upload to GitHub
            - upload to GitHub for cacheing
        + Install to directory at bootstrap time
            + determine the directory to install to using a class
    * steps: same as before
        + Perhaps need to generate cpanfile in each repo, only install and run
          `App::scan_prereqs_cpanfile` if `cpanfile` missing.
    * decreasing deps:
        + Need to outline a set of modules that are pure-Perl or can be translated
          to pure-Perl equivalents.
        + Some of these can be installed as the base dependencies of all the
          Orbital::Payload::* modules.
        + Others need to be set up to be installed based on context:
            + e.g., if loading on GitHub actions, then load everything needed there
        + Create a way of specifying features that require different sets of
          modules in a distribution.
        + Use a loader function to look up the features needed by a module and
          install if necessary.
        + Need to have a context for installation and loading which holds the
          directories for bootstrapping.

# Workflow graph

- Task
    * Something that can be run.
        + `exec()` calls
        + code
    * Can succeed or fail.
        + A future?
    * Has dependencies.
    * Has inputs / outputs
        + Can be variables (e.g., parameters), directories, files
        + Outputs: stdout/stderr
    * Dependency graph:
        + e.g., Task B depends on A.output0
    * Tasks can have a mergeable role.
    * Tasks can have a retryable role.
    * Tasks can have subtasks?
        + A graph of subtasks?
    * Can have specialised tasks for CIs
        + e.g., on GitHub Actions, this would indicate which
          OS the task is running on
- Resources
    * lockable / mutex
        + Some resources can only be accessed for writing by one task at a time,
          e.g., installing CPAN modules to a library directory, running apt-get.
- Scheduling
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffmanâ€“Graham_algorithm>
    * <https://metacpan.org/pod/Bencher::Scenario::GraphTopologicalSortModules>
        + <https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Graph::Util>
        + <https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm::Dependency>
- Workflow graph
    * DAG
        + Maybe in the future use strongly connected components to do
          condensation of any directed graph?
- `Task::Apt::Install`
    * Definition of `Task::Apt::Install`
        + `apt-get install [-y] [package-list]`
            + where `-y` option is boolean and optional.
            + where `package-list` option is array and required.
    * Given two tasks of type `Task::Apt::Install`,
        + Mutually exclusive: can not run multiple instances of
          `Task::Apt::Install` at the same time since they all require
          access to the `dpkg` lock.
        + Mergeable: if the options other than `package-list` are the same,
          then they can be merged by merging the arrays of `package-list`.

# Organisation of project

- Payload:
    * Environment:
        + Language
        + DB (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
        + XWindows
    * System:
        + Operating system
        + Package management system
    * Service:
        + Usually a web service
    * VCS: version control system
- database
    * `pkg/`: packages. These can be from source (for FOSS code) or binary-only (for proprietary code).
        + e.g., `pkg/gui/gtk3`
            + inside of this create definitions such as
[[!format txt """ [[!inline pagenames="doc/development/design/pkg-def.txt.ex" raw=yes ]] """]]
        + e.g., `pkg/perl/Gtk3` for <https://p3rl.org/Gtk3>
            + depends on `pkg/gui/gtk3` with feature :glib-introspection
        + Need a mapper from external packages to database.
            + e.g., `CPANPackage($Name) -> Pkg('main:pkg/perl/$Name')`
            + must be overrideable: in case a fork needs to be used or in the example of Perl, an <https://p3rl.org/Alt> module.
    * `sys/`: os  package manager + distribution
        + e.g., sys/os/{windows,linux,macos}
        + e.g., sys/dist/{debian,ubuntu}, system/dist/fedora
        + e.g., system/dist/{msys2,chocolatey}
        + e.g., sys/dist/{homebrew,fink,macports}
    * `env/`: language {perl,python,go}
        + env/perl/dist/Strawberry
        + env/python/dist/Anaconda
    * `role/`: BLAS-interface, LAPACK-interface, XWindows-server, SQL-server, web-browser
        + e.g., role/server/xwindows: provided by Xorg, Xephyr, Xvfb

# CI of project modules

- Pull from `launch-site`.
- For every repo in { `GITHUB_SHA`, `cpanfile-git` } and `launch-site/vendor/`,
  checkout the version of that repo.
