# Bootstrapping

- Current
    * config:
        + Install directory
            + global install: no directory specified (so installs to `perl -V:sitelib`)
            + CI install: in `~/.orbital`.
                + Only when $ENV{CI} is true
            + default: relative to launch-site repo
    * steps:
        1. Install `cpm` (from vendor submodules) if not available
        2. Install `cpanm` using `cpm`.
        3. Install `App::scan_prereqs_cpanfile` using `cpanm`.
        4. Generate a `cpanfile` for every orbital-transfer submodule.
        5. Install dependencies from `cpanfile` for every orbital-transfer
           submodule using `cpm` then `cpanm`.
- Future
    * config:
        + Install to directory, upload to GitHub
        + Install to directory at bootstrap time
            + determine the directory to install to using a class
    * steps: same as before
        + Perhaps need to generate cpanfile in each repo, only install and run
          `App::scan_prereqs_cpanfile` if `cpanfile` missing.

# Workflow graph

- Task
    * Something that can be run.
    * Has dependencies.
    * Has inputs / outputs
        + Can be parameters, directories, files
    * Can have specialised tasks for CIs
        + e.g., on GitHub Actions, this would indicate which
          OS the task is running on
- Resources
    * lockable / mutex
        + Some resources can only be accessed for writing by one task at a time,
          e.g., installing CPAN modules to a library directory, running apt-get.
